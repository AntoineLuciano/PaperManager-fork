# PaperManager

## How it works

<div class="pm-steps" markdown>

<div class="pm-step" markdown>
<span class="pm-step__n">1</span>

### Add a paper

Drag in a PDF or paste an arXiv, DOI or PubMed link. The metadata is looked up for you;
you check it and press save.
</div>

<div class="pm-step" markdown>
<span class="pm-step__n">2</span>

### PaperManager reads it

In the background it writes a summary, pulls out figures, tables and references, and
suggests topics and tags.
</div>

<div class="pm-step" markdown>
<span class="pm-step__n">3</span>

### You read, ask and connect

Read the PDF with the summary, a guided tour and visual explanations beside it, then ask
questions across everything you have read.
</div>

</div>

New here? [First steps](user-guide/first-steps.md) walks through one paper from upload to
concept map in about ten minutes.

## What you get

<div class="pm-row" markdown>
<div markdown>

### One library for every paper

Search the full text, filter by project, topic, tag, author or reading status, and see at a
glance what is still unread.

<div class="pm-row pm-row--flip" markdown>
<div markdown>

### Everything about a paper in one view

The left side switches between the PDF, the summary, figures, tables, references and related
papers. The right side keeps your notes, highlights and a chat about the paper open beside
it.

</div>

<div class="pm-row" markdown>
<div markdown>

### A guided tour through a long paper

An overview, what you can skip, and 6–12 stops that jump to the passages that matter, with
the concepts each one relies on.

### How a whole project fits together

The key concepts of every paper in a project and how they relate, as a graph you can filter
by author, year and kind of concept.

</div>

### Ask your whole library

The knowledge chat answers from your papers and cites them; a citation opens the paper
beside the chat. Answers can carry concept cards (formulas, plots, animations) and 3D
protein structures you can rotate. Narrow a question with `@project:`, `@topic:` or
`@paper:`, branch off from any question, or let it search the web too.

### Who publishes what at NeurIPS, ICML, CVPR, ACL, ...

Browse the accepted papers of 22 conference series by institution (rank, research-area mix,
collaborators, every paper) or by topic: type one or paste an abstract and see which
universities and companies publish most on it and the closest papers, one click from your
library.

## Where to go next

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-rocket-launch:{ .lg .middle } **Install it**

    ---

    Run your own instance with Docker on your computer or on Heroku, with your own
    database and keys.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Hosting your own](self_hosting.md)

-   :material-school:{ .lg .middle } **Learn the app**

    ---

    Upload a paper, read it with the tour, put it in a project and ask questions about it.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: First steps](user-guide/first-steps.md)

-   :material-robot-happy:{ .lg .middle } **Use it from Claude**

    ---

    The MCP server gives Claude Desktop and Claude Code 38 tools to search, read and edit
    your library.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: MCP server](user-guide/mcp-server.md)

-   :material-code-braces:{ .lg .middle } **Work on the code**

## Under the hood

```mermaid
graph LR
    UI["React app"] --> API["FastAPI backend"]
    MCP["Claude via MCP"] --> API
    API --> DB[("Neo4j<br/>knowledge graph")]
    API --> Drive["Google Drive<br/>PDFs and figures"]
    API --> LLM["Claude / any<br/>OpenAI-compatible model"]
    API --> Ext["Semantic Scholar<br/>CrossRef · arXiv"]
```

Every paper, author, topic, project, note and concept is a node in one Neo4j graph, so the
same data powers the library, the chat, the concept map and the Cypher editor. PDFs stay in
your own Google Drive. More in [Architecture](technical/architecture.md).

PaperManager is open source. The project page at
[niklas-abraham.de](https://niklas-abraham.de/projects/papermanager/) has the story behind
it; issues and pull requests are welcome on
[GitHub](https://github.com/NiklasAbraham/PaperManager).
